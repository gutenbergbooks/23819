<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Several years ago, the maker of this version translated into French one
of the early works of H. W. Longfellow. This circumstance was not
forgotten by the American poet who kindly consented to listen to this
new attempt at rendering into English the "CHANSON DE ROLAND."</p>

<p>To his encouragement is due the present publication. The writer will
ever proudly treasure up the remembrance of his friendly welcome and
counsel....</p>

<hr class="two" />

<p>The translator has followed, as literally as possible, the text of the
Oxford MS., as revised by L&eacute;on Gautier. The parts inclosed in
parentheses are interpolations of the learned Professor. This revised
text should be kept in hand by the English reader for comparison with
the original, which is nine centuries old. The translator may thus be
more likely to obtain the indulgence of the reader for the quaint
representation, in a modern language, of the coloring of this most
ancient poem.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[viii]</span>The orthography of all the names, as well as their prosodic accent, has
been preserved in their ancient form; and accordingly, an index has been
appended to the work.</p>

<p>The seventh edition of L&eacute;on Gautier's "CHANSON DE ROLAND," contains a
vast amount of explanatory notes, grammatical and historical, to which
the reader is referred.</p>


<h4>HISTORY OF THE POEM.</h4>

<p>On the 15th of August, 778, in a little Pyrenean Valley, still known in
our days by the name of Ronceval, a terrible event took place.
Charlemagne, returning from his expedition to Spain, crossed that valley
and the Pyrenees, leaving his rear-guard in command of Roland, Prefect
of the Marches of Brittany. His main army had passed unmolested; but at
the moment when the rear-guard advanced into the defiles of the
mountain, thousands of Gascons rushed from their ambush, fell upon the
French army and slaughtered the whole guard to the last man. So perished
Roland.</p>

<p>Eginhard, the historian of Charlemagne, terminates his narrative with
these words: "The House-intendant, (Regi&aelig; mens&aelig; pr&aelig;positus), Eggihard,
Anselm, Count of the Palace, Roland, Prefect of the Marches of Brittany
(Hruolandus britannici limitis pr&aelig;fectus), with many more, perished in
<span class='pagenum'>[ix]</span>the fight. It was not possible to take revenge on the spot. The
treacherous attempt once perpetrated, the enemy dispersed and left no
trace." (Eginhard's Life of Charlemagne, Vol. I., p. 31; edition of the
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'histoire de France.)</p>

<p>From the moment of the defeat of Ronceval, legend commenced its labor
upon this truly epic event which, in its origin, is absolutely French,
but has found its echoes throughout Europe, from Iceland to Eastern
regions.</p>

<p>The commentators generally agree in dating the composition of the Poem
before the first crusade in the year 1096. The author, it is
ascertained, was Norman, the dialect used by him being Norman
throughout. Whether this author was really Turoldus, named in the last
line of the Poem, is a point which L&eacute;on Gautier refuses to affirm. We
refer the reader to the very interesting preface of <i>Genin</i>, and to the
learned introductions of L&eacute;on Gautier, for more complete information.</p>

<hr class="two" />

<p>The word "<i>Aoi</i>," which is placed at the end of every stanza, and found in
no other ancient French poems, is interpreted differently by the
commentators. M. Francisque Michel assimilated it at first to the
termination of an ecclesiastical chant&mdash;Preface, xxvii.&mdash;and later to
the Saxon <i>Abeg</i>, or the English <i>Away</i>, as a sort of refrain which the
"<i>jongleur</i>" repeated at the end of the couplets. M. <span class='pagenum'>[x]</span>G&eacute;nin explains it by
<i>ad viam</i>, a vei, avoie, away! it is done, let us go on!</p>

<p>M. Gautier, with his skeptical honesty, declares the word unexplained.
See Note 9, p. 4, of his seventh edition.</p>
